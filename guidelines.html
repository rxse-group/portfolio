          <h2>Academic Journey</h2>

          <p>
            Stepping into tertiary life felt like entering a different kind of
            space — not louder, not busier, just heavier with responsibility.
            It’s the first time I’ve had to balance who I am and who I’m trying
            to become in such a structured environment. I’m still adjusting to
            that weight.
          </p>

          <p>
            Studying while managing my own creative and digital work has been
            more demanding than I expected. It’s not just about finding time —
            it’s about shaping it properly. I’ve learned that if I don’t create
            a rhythm for myself, the days start pulling me in opposite
            directions. That’s where discipline quietly becomes a survival
            skill.
          </p>

          <p>
            This journey has been less about grades and more about
            self-organisation. I’m learning how to prioritise, how to work with
            intention, and how to stay present when everything moves fast. It’s
            made me sharper. More aware of what I want and how I operate.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ve also become more honest with myself. Some days I’m overwhelmed.
            Some days I’m proud. Most days, I’m somewhere in between — figuring
            things out in real time. And I’m realising that this mix is normal.
            It’s part of the process of becoming someone who can stand firmly in
            both the academic world and the creative world without losing
            themselves.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m still growing into the balance. But I’m getting there. <br />

        <!-- GROUP WORK -->
        <div id="groupwork">
          <h2>Group Work — (Tuckman's stages)</h2>

          <p>
            Working on a group assignment mostly by myself wasn’t the situation
            I expected, but it ended up teaching me more about teamwork than any
            functioning group could have.
          </p>

          <p>
            I found myself moving through Tuckman’s stages almost as if I had a
            team — except it was just me handling every layer. Forming became
            about identifying the roles that should exist. Storming turned into
            sorting out the confusion that comes from taking on everything at
            once. Norming arrived when I finally shaped a clear structure for
            the work. And performing was the moment the assignment started
            flowing because I had organised it well enough to move without
            friction.
          </p>

          <p>
            It made me think a lot about what good collaboration actually
            requires. It isn’t the number of people — it’s alignment, shared
            rhythm, and clarity. I had to create that alone, and it showed me
            that I naturally work best when there’s order, visuals, and defined
            responsibilities. I function better with a system.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even without a full team, the project pushed me to apply the model
            in a real way. It helped me understand my own working style — how I
            plan, how I take initiative, and how I navigate situations where the
            structure is missing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next time I work with a proper group, I’ll step into it with a
            clearer sense of how to guide everything toward that performing
            stage. <br />
            <strong>
              Not as a theory — but something I’ve actually had to live through.
